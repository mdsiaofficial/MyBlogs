### Good things of Competitive programming

Competitive programming is a fun and rewarding activity that challenges your logical thinking, problem-solving skills and coding abilities. It is also a great way to learn new algorithms, data structures and programming languages. In this blog post, I will share some of the good things of competitive programming that I have experienced and enjoyed.
One of the good things of competitive programming is that it helps you improve your coding skills. By participating in contests, you get to practice writing efficient, elegant and bug-free code under time pressure and with limited resources. You also get to learn from other programmers who may have different approaches or solutions to the same problem. This can help you broaden your perspective and discover new tricks and techniques.
Another good thing of competitive programming is that it boosts your confidence and motivation. When you solve a hard problem or rank high in a contest, you feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. You also get to challenge yourself and push your limits. You may encounter problems that seem impossible at first, but with perseverance and creativity, you can find a way to crack them. This can help you overcome your fears and doubts and develop a growth mindset.
A third good thing about competitive programming is that it opens up opportunities for you. By doing competitive programming, you can build a strong portfolio that showcases your skills and achievements. You can also network with other programmers who share your passion and interests. You may find mentors, friends or collaborators who can help you grow and learn. You may also get noticed by recruiters or employers who are looking for talented programmers.
These are some of the good things of competitive programming that I have experienced and enjoyed. Of course, there are many more benefits that you can gain from this activity. If you are interested in competitive programming, I encourage you to give it a try and see for yourself how fun and rewarding it can be.
