## Enhancing Internet Speed Through CMD Commands

To improve your internet connection using cmd, you can leverage several built-in Windows features. These include managing DNS cache, pinging the default gateway, and adjusting TCP settings with the `netsh int tcp` command.

When facing a slow internet connection, the usual first step is to restart the device or router. If this doesn't resolve the issue, reaching out to the ISP is the next step. If the problem persists even after contacting the ISP, some users might consider changing their service provider. To potentially avoid these steps, here are some strategies for boosting your internet speed using cmd.

### How to Improve Internet Speed Using CMD?

There are numerous built-in Windows commands and tools that can address common issues like slow internet. To utilize these cmd tricks, you don't need to be an expert; just follow the instructions provided.

1. **Test Internet Speed Using CMD Pings to Default Gateway**

   You can gauge your internet connection speed by sending ping packets to your default gateway. To find your default gateway, use the `ipconfig /all` command. Once you have the IP address of your default gateway, initiate a continuous ping by typing `ping -t <your default gateway address>`. The time field value will indicate the time it takes to receive an acknowledgment from the gateway.

   Note that while a lower time value suggests a faster network, excessive pinging can consume network bandwidth and resources from your default gateway. Although the data packets for ping are minimal, they do consume bandwidth.

2. **Release and Renew IP Address**

   If you're connected via WiFi, you might experience a temporary speed increase by executing `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew`. However, this command won't affect LAN connections.

3. **Flush DNS Cache**

   Your computer stores a list of frequently accessed websites and their corresponding IP addresses in the DNS resolver cache. Over time, this data can become outdated. By flushing the DNS resolver cache with the `ipconfig /flushdns` command, you remove outdated entries and make room for new ones.

   Initially, you might experience slower connection speeds due to the need for new DNS lookups for each resource. However, you'll likely notice faster website loading times soon after.

4. **Adjust Internet Speed Using CMD 'Netsh int tcp' Command**

   Enter the following command in your command prompt window:

   ```
   netsh commands cmd
   ```

   If the Receive Window Autotuning level is not set to 'Normal', run the following command:

   ```
   netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal
   ```

   This command adjusts your TCP receive window from a disabled or restricted state to 'Normal', which can enhance your internet download speed.

   Next, check the 'Windows scaling heuristics' parameter by typing:

   ```
   netsh interface tcp show heuristics
   ```

   If it's enabled, Microsoft might be limiting your internet connection. To bypass this, enter the following command:

   ```
   netsh interface tcp set heuristics disabled
   ```

   After executing these steps, you can repeat Step 1 to measure the time it takes to receive a ping acknowledgment from the default gateway and verify if your internet speed has improved.

5. **Boost Streaming Speed by Disabling Throttling**

   If you generally have good internet speeds but struggle with streaming, your ISP might be throttling speeds for certain content types. To counteract this, you'll need to add a firewall rule. Enter the following command in cmd:

   ```
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="StopThrottling" dir=in action=block remoteip=173.194.55.0/24,206.111.0.0/16 enable=yes
   ```

### Conclusion

The cmd tricks outlined above are quick fixes that can help optimize your internet connection. Before resorting to more drastic measures like contacting your ISP or changing service providers, try executing these commands first.

### FAQs

- **What is the netsh command to fix the internet?**
 Netsh is a cmd tool in Windows that can be used to adjust network configurations. A popular command to reset the TCP/IP configuration is: `netsh int ip reset`.

- **Which cmd tool can I use to test Internet speed?**
 You can use the Python-based `speedtest-cli` on Windows to test your internet speed. After installing Python, run `pip install speedtest-cli` to install.

- **Why do some internet connections speed up and others slow down?**
 Internet speed is influenced by various factors, including your router, cable quality, signal strength, device modem, and ISP. These factors can cause internet speed to vary.

- **Does flushing DNS speed up the internet?**
 Flushing DNS doesn't directly improve your internet speed, but it can enhance the performance of websites that were previously slow.

- **How do I run a speed test from the command line?**
 A simple way to run a speed test is to ping a site you want to access. For example, type `ping google.com` in Command Prompt and press enter. The results will display statistics related to the speed of your internet connection to that site. For a more comprehensive speed test, you can use the `speedtest-cli` tool mentioned earlier. After installing it, simply run `speedtest-cli` in your command prompt to get a detailed report of your internet speed.
