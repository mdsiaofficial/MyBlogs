# why pointers in c/c++  cannot work with ++ operators?

Actually, pointers in C and C++ **can** work with the `++` operator. The `++` operator can be used to increment a pointer, which means it will point to the next memory location of the type it is pointing to. Here's a brief explanation:

- **Incrementing a Pointer**: When you use the `++` operator on a pointer, it increases the pointer's value by the size of the data type it points to. For example, if you have a pointer to an `int`, using `++` will move the pointer to the next `int` in memory.

Here's a simple example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    int *ptr = arr;

    std::cout << "Initial value: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Output: 10

    ptr++; // Increment the pointer
    std::cout << "After increment: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `ptr++` moves the pointer to the next integer in the array.

- **Why It Works**: The `++` operator works with pointers because it is designed to handle memory addresses. When you increment a pointer, it moves to the next memory location based on the size of the data type it points to.

If you have any specific scenarios or issues with pointers and the `++` operator, feel free to share, and I can help clarify further!
